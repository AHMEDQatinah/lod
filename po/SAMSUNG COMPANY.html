            <p>The Samsung Group[3] (or simply Samsung, stylized as SΛMSUNG) (Korean: 삼성 [samsʌŋ]) is a South Korean
                multinational manufacturing conglomerate headquartered in Samsung Town, Seoul, South Korea.[1] It
                comprises numerous affiliated businesses,[1] most of them united under the Samsung brand, and is the
                largest South Korean chaebol (business conglomerate). As of 2020, Samsung has the 8th highest global
                brand value.[4]

                Samsung was founded by Lee Byung-chul in 1938 as a trading company. Over the next three decades, the
                group diversified into areas including food processing, textiles, insurance, securities, and retail.
                Samsung entered the electronics industry in the late 1960s and the construction and shipbuilding
                industries in the mid-1970s; these areas would drive its subsequent growth. Following Lee's death in
                1987, Samsung was separated into five business groups – Samsung Group, Shinsegae Group, CJ Group and
                Hansol Group, and Joongang Group.

                Notable Samsung industrial affiliates include Samsung Electronics (the world's largest information
                technology company, consumer electronics maker and chipmaker measured by 2017 revenues),[5][6] Samsung
                Heavy Industries (the world's 2nd largest shipbuilder measured by 2010 revenues),[7] and Samsung
                Engineering and Samsung C&T Corporation (respectively the world's 13th and 36th largest construction
                companies).
